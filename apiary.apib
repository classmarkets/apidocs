# classmarkets HTTP API

This is the documentation for the public classmarkets API.

## About this documentation

The classmarkets API documentation is authored in [API Blueprint][blueprint].
The source is [publicly available on GitHub][github].  The canonical version is
the HTML rendering at [http://apidocs.classmarkets.com/][canonical].

It is also [published to Apiary][apiary]. Apiary offers example requests in
several programming languages, a mock server that can be used to build client
prototypes, as well as a console that demonstrates the API in the browser.

## Alternative formats

This documentation exists in multiple formats. [A full listing is available
here][tree].

The all in one blueprint is [hosted by Apiary][apiary.apib]. For consumption by
machines we provide the [AST in JSON][ast].

If you want to build a client for only some of the endpoints, the partial
blueprints may be useful &ndash; see the [directory listing][tree].

<!--
as well as automatically built [RAML][raml] and [Swagger][swagger] definitions.
Please note that classmarkets is not using the RAML and Swagger definitions and
can not guarantee their completeness nor correctness. Specifically, both
formats support only one example transaction per endpoint.

## General concepts

Unless otherwise noted in the documentation for a specific endpoint, the
following concepts apply.

The API transport is JSON over HTTPS. Responses will indicate a Content-Type of
"application/json". Requests with a JSON body preferrably have a Content-Type
of "application/json" in the header as well, or no Content-Type at all. It is
an error to send e. g. "text/plain" in the header of a JSON request body. We
strongly recommend to indicate the Content-Type explicitly to guarantee forward
compatibility.

Requests are authenticated using OAuth2 access tokens. This is described in
detail below.

Dates and times are represented in a format specified by [RFC 3339][rfc3339],
such as `2016-04-24T11:29:07.612797822Z`. The precision for fractional seconds
may vary but will not exceed nanoseconds. Times are given in UTC. Named
timezones, such as "GMT", "CET" are not supported, because [they are
ambiguous][timezones].

[rfc3339]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339
[timezones]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_time_zone_abbreviations

## A word on data sanity

classmarkets ingests data from generally untrustworthy sources. The API does
not attempt to sanitize this data, because what sanitization means depends on
the context this data is used in. This means that per se you cannot trust any
data you receive from the API, especially from the listings endpoints.

This is not a hypothetical situation. There *are* "email addresses" like `';
DROP TABLE users; --`. There *are* listing descriptions containing malformed
HTML and potentially malicious JavaScript. It is the client's responsibility to
sanitize and/or escape properly.

## Backwards compatibility

With the following exceptions, every change to the API is considered to break
backwards compatibility and will result in a new version for affected
endpoints. Changes we do not consider to break compatibility and may be
introduced without prior notice are:

* Adding a new attribute to a resource, be it at the top level or to any nested
  attribute.
* Adding a new value to an enumeration, be it an attribute or a request
  parameter.
* Removing a value from an enumeration, be it an attribute or a request
  parameter, if and only if the API can assume a sensible default behaviour
  when receiving this value in the future.
* Adding a new, optional request parameter.
* Adding a new endpoint.

<!-- TODO: mailing list for communicating changes? What about BC breaks that are required due to security issues? -->

# Group Authentication and authorization

<!--
All requests to endpoints other than the authentication endpoints must be
authorized with access tokens.

First, acquire an access token using one of the methods described below. Then
include your token in all further requests like so:

    GET /some/endpoint HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.classmarkets.com
    Authorization: Bearer UqMv7BFvQCmE84mqG7SWOw


First, issue an Access and Refresh token using the /auth/v1/token endpoint. You
received your client id and secret when you registered for the API.


The scope parameter will determine how powerful the access token is, e.g. what
can be done with it. To limit the possible damage that can be done if the token
is disclosed, you should always make the scope as narrow as possible.


```
POST /auth/v1/token?grant_type=client_credentials&scope=api.listings.readonly&client_id=91a5bd6e-bbdc-4b4b-bc83-bd81259d6098&client_secret=ATcc/BmVhcEp-MlpQo4M6MdP_zZ4BBE2 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.classmarkets.com
Accept: application/json
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Length: 0
```

Assuming the client id and secret are correct, the API will issue an access
token.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "access_token": "UqMv7BFvQCmE84mqG7SWOw", 
    "expires_in": 3600, 
    "scope": "api.listings.readonly", 
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```


Include this token in all future requests like so:

```
GET /search/v1/job-offer/6JV76J-339533 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.classmarkets.com
Authorization: Bearer UqMv7BFvQCmE84mqG7SWOw
```
-->

## Access tokens [/auth/v1/token]

The classmarkets API requires all requests to be authorized. Before you can
interact with the API in a meaningful way, you have to acquire an access token.
You will then present this access token in all following request headers, like
so:

    GET /some/endpoint HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.classmarkets.com
    Authorization: Bearer UqMv7BFvQCmE84mqG7SWOw

If you are familiar with OAuth 2, feel free to skip the rest of this section.

The string "UqMv7BFvQCmE84mqG7SWOw" in the example above is the access token.
To you it is just an opaque string. Keep your tokens safe! Whoever gains
access to them can use the API on your behalf.

Tokens are acquired using one of the OAuth 2 authorization methods, also known
as grant types.

To get the API to issue an access token, you will have to authenticate yourself
(e.g. prove that you are you) and also indicate what you are planning to do
with your access token. The details of the authentication depend on the
`grant_type` and are detailed below. The declaration of intend is always the
same and happens with the `scope` parameter.

<!--
The access token has a limited lifetime, which is indicated in the `expires_in`
response attribute (given in seconds). After that time, the access token is no
longer valid and a new token must be issued. Of course you can also issue a new
token before that time.
-->


### Authenticate with client credentials [POST /auth/v1/token?grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={client_id}&client_secret={client_secret}&scope={scope}]

While OAuth 2 specifies several authentication methods the API only supports
the "client credentials" method. This method is suitable for applications that
act on their own behalf, as opposed to applications that act on behalf of a
particular (usually human) user.

Authentication is based on your client id and secret, both of which you
received when signing up for your API account.

+ Parameters
    + `client_id`: `91a5bd6e-bbdc-4b4b-bc83-bd81259d6098` (string, required) -
      client_id identifies the software interacting with the API. This id is
      generated and communicated by classmarkets when signing up for an API
      account.
    + `client_secret`: `ATcc/BmVhcEp-MlpQo4M6MdPtzZ4BBE2` (string) - This
      secret is generated and communicated by classmarkets when signing up for
      an API account.
    + scope: `api.listings.readonly,api.users` (string) - A comma separated
      list of scopes for the access token. The scope determines how powerful
      the access token is, e.g. what can be done with it. To limit the possible
      damage that can be done if the token is disclosed, it should be as narrow
      as possible.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

    + Body

            {
                "access_token": "UqMv7BFvQCmE84mqG7SWOw",
                "expires_in": 3600,
                "scope": "api.listings.readonly",
                "token_type": "Bearer"
            }
